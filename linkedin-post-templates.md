🚀 Just built my first AI-powered web application! 

Introducing a Smart Maintenance Incident Management System with intelligent chat-based validation:

✨ Key Features:
• Interactive dashboard with real-time filtering
• AI chatbot that validates incident rejections 
• 3-question reasoning system to ensure quality decisions
• Mobile-first responsive design
• Smart approval workflows

🛠️ Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python Flask
🤖 AI Logic: Natural language processing for decision validation
📱 Design: Modern card-based UI with dark/light themes

The coolest part? When rejecting an incident, the AI asks 3 targeted questions and only approves the rejection if the reasoning is comprehensive - otherwise it requires supervisor approval!

## Option 2: Business Impact Focus
```
💡 What if AI could help prevent bad business decisions?

I just built a maintenance incident management system where AI validates rejection decisions through intelligent conversations.

🎯 The Problem: Incident rejections without proper reasoning
🤖 The Solution: AI chatbot that asks 3 key questions:
   1. Primary reason for rejection?
   2. Safety concerns identified?
   3. Procedural violations present?

Only approves rejection if reasoning is comprehensive!

📊 Business Impact:
• Reduces supervisor escalations
• Improves decision quality
• Creates audit trails
• Guides user training

This is my first step into building AI-powered business tools. Excited to explore how AI can enhance human decision-making rather than replace it!

What business processes do you think could benefit from AI validation?

• AI chatbot for rejection validation
• Mobile-responsive design
• Real-time filtering and search

🧠 What I learned:
• How to implement conversational AI logic
